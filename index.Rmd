# Research

***

I've yet to have any publications and my CV looks more like a resume but my research work is to be based on the desert cactus mouse, Peromyscus eremicus. This North American mouse has an amazing ability to resist severe dehydration and we're trying to understand how. My first research project will be analyzing the microbiota of peromyscus through RNA sequencing.
